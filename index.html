    <title> The Role of Rotor Blade Design in Helicopter Performance </title>

      <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p>  
Helicopters rely on rotating blades to generate lift, making the rotor blade design central to their performance. This is unlike aeroplanes which rely on forward motion to push air over fixed wings. These blades act like rotating wings, constantly moving through the air to generate lift and allow the aircraft to hover, climb, and manoeuvre in ways that fixed wing aircraft cannot. Because of this, rotor blade design plays a central role in determining how well a helicopter performs. Engineers need to balance aerodynamic efficiency, structural strength, vibration control, safety, and cost.
